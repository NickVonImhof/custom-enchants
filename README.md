## Experience Enchantments

### Overview:

This datapack adds a variety of custom enchantments which far surpass the power of regular minecraft enchantments, but they come at a cost: each time you use the enchantment, it consumes some of your experience. If you have no experience left, using enchantments will instead cost health!

Currently, there are enchantments on your chestplate, boots, sword, shield, and carrot on a stick (with more to come). Each category of enchantment is triggered in a different way, explained below. To give yourself an enchantment, hold the relevant item (like chestplate, sword, etc), and type ```/enchant @s enchants:<name_of_desired_enchantment> <level>```.

### Chestplate Enchantments

Activate/deactivate these enchantments by pressing F, or toggling your mainhand item into your offhand. This will toggle the enchantment effect ON or OFF. These enchantments cost experience while they are active.

- #### Blitz
    - Max lvl: 5
    - Greatly enhances the player's speed, jump strength, and step height, allowing them to sprint over almost any terrain. Higher levels increase the strength of this effect.

- #### Zephyr
    - Max lvl: 1
    - Allows the player to float at whatever elevation they are currently at. Looking up will increase their elevation, while looking straight down will decrease it.

- #### Ironskin
    - Max lvl: 1
    - Completely nullifies incoming damage and knockback to the player. Consumes additional experience for each instance of damage mitigation.

- #### Enlarging
    - Max lvl: 10
    - Increases the size, speed, jump strength, interaction range, and many other attributes for the player. Higher levels increase the strength of this effect.

- #### Diminishing
    - Max lvl: 3
    - Decreases the size (greatly), speed (slightly), and interaction range of the player. Higher levels increase the strength of this effect.

### Boots Enchantments

Trigger these enchantments by pressing shift, or Sneak. 

- #### Warping
    - Max lvl: 4
    - Teleport forwards where you are looking. This works through blocks. Additionally, when looking at a mob, you will automatically teleport directly behind them, instead of the max distance. Higher levels increase the max distance you can teleport. 

- #### Mistwalker
    - Max lvl: 1
    - Disappear into mist. You will enter spectator mode and can fly where you please. Press sneak again to become corporeal. Looking straight down while pressing sneak will NOT cause you to become corporeal (this is to allow you to fly downwards without forcing you to disable the effect).

- #### Galestep
    - Max lvl: 3
    - Leap forwards in a burst of wind. You can hold down sneak to repeatedly trigger this effect. Higher levels will decrease the (already very short) cooldown. (At max lvl of 3, holding down crouch will cause you to fly through the air at mach 2+.)

- #### Rewind
    - Max lvl: 1
    - Recall back in time to the position you were at 3(ish) seconds ago. This will also restore your health to whatever it was at that point as well.

### Sword Enchantments

Trigger these enchantments by hitting things.

- #### Explosive Touch
    - Max lvl: 4
    - Cause an explosion on any entity you hit. Higher levels will increase the size of the explosion. (Note: this explosion will damage you!! Usage with Reach is recommended.)

- #### Reach
    - Max lvl: 2
    - Increases the range that you can hit entities from. Higher levels will further increase the range.

- #### Vitality Touch
    - Max lvl: 3
    - Cause any entity you hit to gain health. Higher levels will increase the strength of the effect.

### Shield

Trigger these enchantments by blocking with a shield.

- #### Vitality Ward
    - Max lvl: 2
    - Rapidly regenerate your health. Higher levels will increase the speed at which your health regenerates.

- #### Reflection
    - Max lvl: 3
    - Create a bubble around you which will reflect all incoming projectiles back towards where they came from. Any projectile that is fired from inside the bubble will instead be erased from existence. Higher levels will increase the size of the bubble.

### Carrot On A Stick

Trigger these enchantments by pressing or holding right click whith a carrot on a stick.

- #### Flamethrower
    - Max lvl: 5
    - Hold to shoot flames where you are looking. Higher levels will increase the speed and longevity of the flame projectile.

- #### Fulmination
    - Max lvl: 5
    - Hold to charge up your fulmination. Release to fire a projectile that will explode on contact with anything, causing a bigger explosion based off of how much you charged it. Higher levels will increase the rate of charge, as well as the maximum charge.

- #### Wither Skull
    - Max lvl: 3
    - Fire a wither skull. Higher levels will increase the speed and longevity of the wither skull.

- #### Abyssal Ray
    - Max lvl: 5
    - Fire a hitscan damaging ray where you are looking. Higher levels will increase the damage of this ray.

- #### Celestial Ray
    - Max lvl: 5
    - Fire a hitscan healing ray where you are looking, granting regeneration to entites that you hit for 3 seconds. Higher levels will increase the strength of this regeneration effect.
